                The team has been playing some of the best football it ever has been. Besting some of the best teams in
                dominant
                fashion and never dropping a game to 2nd place team in the <a
                    href="https://www.premierleague.com/tables" target="_blank">Premier League</a>, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C." target="_blank">Arsenal</a>. Many have seem to
                attribute this to Pep Guardiola's reignited passion for the
                team with never before seen tactics being sprung into play and alot more envolvement into the team. But
                obviously we can not talk about Manchester City's future and current success without bringing up the
                blossoming
                Star Erling Halaand. A player who at his first year playing for the Premier League has already broken
                the
                record
                for most goals in all competitions not to mention he is only 22 years old, he makes it look all too
                easy.
                Ever
                since Manchester City said bye to their franchise player <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Ag%C3%BCero">Kun Aguero</a> there has been a wide gap in
                the
                Striker position and Erling Halaand makes sure he feels that gap and more. These are all the reasons I
                believe
                that this year is the year Manchester City finally grab the Champions League trophy that they've been
                missing.
